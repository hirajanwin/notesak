# Never Enough

*When rich people do crazy things*

---

How much money is enough? *Enough*. Yep, that's the word which is very crucial to understand. Today, there seems to be no limit on what enough entails.

For example, lets take this person
- Rajat Gupta
    - born in Kolkata
    - orphaned as a teenager
    - in mid 40s, was CEO of McKinsey
    - retured in 2007
    - associated with United Nations and World Economic Forum
    - quite successful, $100 million net worth in 2008
- but..
    - he wanted to be a *billionaire*, very badly
    - sat on the board of directors of Goldman Sachs
    - wanted to be in the billionaire circle
    - In 2008, during the financial crisis, Warren Buffett planned to invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs
    - Gupta knew this pretty early and did insider trading
    - went to jail
    - career ruined, no one respects him

He had no sense of enough.

*There is no reason to risk what you have and need, for what you don't have and don't need*

Remember a few things

1. **The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving**

    **Dangerous situation**: more money, power, prestige - increases ambition faster than satisfaction

    Modern capitalism generates two things: **wealth** and **envy**

    Wanting to surpass your peers can be the fuel of hard work. But having a sense of enough is crucial.

    **HAPPINESS = RESULTS - EXPECTATIONS**

2. **Social comparison is the problem**

    - Consider a rookie baseball player, who makes **$500,000** a year
    - Mike Trout, a pro baseball player, on the same team, makes **$36,000,000** a year
    - He may compare himself to the top 10 highest paid hedge fund managers, who make **$340,000,000** a year
    - Those managers want to be the top 5 who make **$770,000,000** a year
    - The top 5 may compare themselves to Warren Buffett, who makes **$3,500,000,000** a year
    - Warren Buffett may compare himself to Jeff Bezos, who made **$24,000,000,000** in 2018

    The point is there is no ceiling, no one will hit it.

3. **"Enough" is not too little**

    "Enough" might look like conservatism, leaving opportunity and potential on the table.

    But its the opposite, "Enough" is realizing that an insatiable appetite for more, will push you to the point of regret.

    Rajat Gupta resorted to stealing because he thought every dollar is worth reaching out for.

4. **There are many things never worth risking, no matter the potential gain**

    Rajat Gupta, when he got out of jail, he learned all the wrong lessons. He was so desperate to get his reputation back, that he started shittalking about wealth.

    So, to conclude
    - **Reputation** is *invaluable*
    - **Freedom and independence** are *invaluable*
    - **Family and friends** are *invaluable*
    - **Being loved** by those who you want to love you is *invaluable*
    - **Happiness** is *invaluable*

    Don't risk the above things
